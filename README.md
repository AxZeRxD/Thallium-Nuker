## Important Note on Malware Detection

Please note that on some systems, antivirus software may flag the Thallium executable as malware. We want to clarify that we do **not** include any form of virus, trojan, or malware in our tools.

These detections are primarily due to the compiler we use for Thallium, which incorporates certain libraries and dependencies that make the code harder to decompile. As a result, some compilers and antivirus programs may mistakenly classify the `.exe` file as malicious.

If you have any doubts, please do not use our tool. Thallium is offered without any obligation, and we respect user choice.
