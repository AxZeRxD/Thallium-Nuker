## Important Note on Malware Detection

Please be aware that on some PCs, antivirus software may flag the Thallium executable as malware. We want to clarify that we do **not** include any type of virus, trojan, or malware in our tools. 

The main reason for these detections is due to the compiler we use to create Thallium. This compiler incorporates certain libraries and dependencies that make the source code harder to decompile. Consequently, many compilers and antivirus programs may mistakenly identify the resulting `.exe` file as malicious.

If you do not trust our tool, please refrain from using it. We do not force anyone to use our tools.
